# LibraryManagementSystem

A Java-based console application demonstrating data structures and MySQL integration.

## About

This project is a console-based Library Management System developed in Java. It showcases the use of linked lists as a data structure to manage a collection of books, integrated with a MySQL database for persistent storage. Key features include:

- Add, borrow, return, and delete books.
- Search books by title, author, or ISBN.
- Save and load library data to/from a file.
- Database synchronization for data consistency.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing book details.
- **Data Structures**: Linked list implementation.
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GihanJeewantha/LibraryManagementSystem.git`
2. Set up MySQL and update `DatabaseManager.java` with your credentials.
3. Compile and run using IntelliJ or command line: `javac com/library/*.java` and `java com.library.Main`.

## Usage
- Run the application and follow the menu prompts (1-9).
- Example: Enter `2` to add a book, then input title, author, and ISBN.

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX.
- Implement user authentication.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
